This repo contains the 'patience project' made by Lea Saffar and Stefan Vukasinovic in 2012 for their first year of school.
The idea was to make a patience game, mainly Solitaire and made it enaught oriented-object to make another patience game with the less changes possible.
Here we tried to make Freecell as a second game, by extending Solitaire's game engine.

The project is uploaded on github in 2019.
The 'worksapce' folder contains all the versions & evolutions of the project in the time (git wasn't used at that time)
The 'test01' folder contains the source code we decided to share with teachers, it is very similar to 'workspace/Patiences2.3'

diff between 'test01' and 'Patience2.3' when work uploaded on github :
- special characters related to french alphabet removed from files Carte.java, Freecell.java, PanFreecell.java, Panneau.java and Solitaire.java
